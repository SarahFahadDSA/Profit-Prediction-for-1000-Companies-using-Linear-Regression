# 1000 Companies Profit Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of the **Introduction to Data Science** course by **Simplilearn**. It focuses on building a linear regression model to predict the profit of 1000 companies based on their R&D, administration, and marketing expenditures.



## Project Overview

The goal is to analyze the relationship between company expenses and profit, and to create a predictive model that estimates profit from these expenses. The dataset contains financial data of 1000 companies, including:

- R&D Spend
- Administration Spend
- Marketing Spend
- State (Categorical)
- Profit

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling categorical variables with encoding  
- Outlier detection and treatment  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Linear Regression model building and evaluation

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
